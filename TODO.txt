TODO:

tokenizer & parser:

  Issue 1: Tokenizer needs a full audit and fuzzing test to ensure its reliability.


code generator:
  Issue 1: The compiler treats int as 8-byte values. This must be reduced to
          4 bytes and also the register size must shrink in half
          (e.g. rax -> eax) when using int.

  Issue 2: we need to add the support for adding 2 integer variables and saving
            the result in a third variable; both at initializing time and reassignment.
